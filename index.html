        Hello. I was having a great deal of trouble even getting the website to display any of the sneaker names. The images would not show up when I tried to append them to the website but it does show the little icon. I'm not really sure whats wrong there. Additionally when I appended the sneaker names as H1 elements, when I went into CSS it would not let me style them at all. I'm a bit worried for being able to code my website on my own, I feel like I don't really understand the language of Java, I understand what it's doing but I don't understand how to write it. I feel like I have hit a brick wall when I try to get things to show up on the page.
